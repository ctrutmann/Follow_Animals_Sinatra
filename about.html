      <h1>About Register Animals</h1>
        <p>Register Animals is a nonprofit dedicated to supporting domestic animals and their caretakers. Using social networking sites as inspiration, Register Animals enables caretakers to create an individualized page for their animal, which the animal's friends can then follow. If the animal ever needs assistance--a new home, a sitter, a search party, or help with med bills--its friends and other animal lovers can be notified, giving the animal a whole support system to tap for love, resources, and human ingenuity.</p>
        <p>Maybe the animal is a horse you took riding lessons on as a kid. Maybe it's the cat you had to leave behind when you moved overseas. Maybe you raise alpacas or show dogs and want a streamlined system for keeping tabs on the sold babies. Maybe you run an animal rescue and want to be notified if one of your adopted animals ever needs a new home.</p>
        </p>Our animals depend on us to advocate for them in a world they can't navigate alone. Give animals the security of a support system. Help us build Register Animals.</p>
